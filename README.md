# soccerdatawithpandas

This is my data analysis/visualization project from a soccer player data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/simrat1193/make-your-soccer-club-and-find-similar-players/data)

I attempt to look into this data and plot relevant graphs

### Plot Age and Weight on a graph
main.py purpose of finding correlation amongst factors such as weight, height, age.

Start handling big dataset of soccer players
radarchart.py serving the purpose of making a chart of players'ability and compatibility. 
How to run radarchart.py:

2. Find out the name of player who you want to see the radar chart
3. Find out his ID
4. The program will ask you to enter his ID in a question prompted 
5. Jot downthe ID and you will see the radarchart by matpotlib
